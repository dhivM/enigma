# enigma
Project for CS61B: Data Structures. 

The goal of the project was to create the Enigma encryption machine used by the Germans in World War 2. I wrote most of the main method,
permutation class, machine class, moving rotor class and fixed rotor class. All machine tests were also written by me.
